. Let's revamp the documentation, readme should be shorter and link to specific pages for cli, tui and frontend.
. need to think about how the app refreshes. The database can be updated by the CLI / TUI and the Frontend does not change. Some sort of optimistic locking maybe?
x Today view - use unicode characters to indicate entry types (see tui and bujo today). The entry text is not aligned with the entry type. The should be vertical centre aligned
x CI build failing
. Today/Review view - chose a better icon for un-complete icon, it should be the . we use to represent a task
. Rename overdue as outstanding tasks
. Make sure icons are consistent across all views
. Update architecture document, remove out of date documents if they are no longer relevant
. in search results you need all the action actions for an entry migrate, cancel, done, etc (and their undo as well)
. the orange highlighting of a entry is unnecessary is the today view
. all views should use indentation as appropriate to show hieracy. Search results is not doing this
