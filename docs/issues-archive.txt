#34 x remove search entries... box from the header
#35 x Let's revamp the documentation, readme should be shorter and link to specific pages for cli, tui and frontend.
#36 x need to think about how the app refreshes. The database can be updated by the CLI / TUI and the Frontend does not change. Some sort of optimistic locking maybe?
#37 x Today view - use unicode characters to indicate entry types (see tui and bujo today). The entry text is not aligned with the entry type. The should be vertical centre aligned
#38 x CI build failing
#39 x Today/Review view - chose a better icon for un-complete icon, it should be the . we use to represent a task
#40 x Rename overdue as outstanding tasks
#41 x Make sure icons are consistent across all views

#45 x the orange highlighting does not work well with mouse. Make keyboard usage sensible.

#55 x verify how questions & answers should work. Add Outstanding questions view to sidebar
#56 x remove red colour from overdue tasks
#57 x outstanding tasks logic seems screwy. The date they are shown under should be the date the were created. Jan 18 is showing lots of entries and I don't know why. Is it showing goals as well - i should only show tasks?
#58 x Search View (and maybe others) - click cycle priority does nothing. Check all actions do something!
#59 x Cannot change type on Today view and probably review review
#60 x The action icons should stay in the same places. Use empty placeholders for icons that are missing.

#82 x How do you add an answer to a question using the capture modal?
#83 x You should be able to click on the circle on the goals in the monthly goals to mark it as completed
#84 x TUI - "No entries for the last 7 days" message should reflect the actual view being displayed, not hardcoded to 7 days
#85 x TUI - overdue tasks still appearing in journal and review views
#86 x FE - migrate entry from pending tasks is not doing anything
#87 x Lists - click on circle should complete list item. Don't need the tick next to it
#89 x Double click on entry in search should take me to the entry in the review view
#76 x BackupService SQL bypass - VerifyBackup() uses direct sql.Open() instead of repository interface (internal/service/backup.go:118-125)
#77 x CLI commands bypass dependency injection - archive, backup, export, import, history commands directly instantiate sqlite repositories
#80 x Package-level mutable state in history command - var listItemRepo anti-pattern (cmd/bujo/cmd/history.go:14-17)
#78 x Service layer interface duplication - services redefine repository interfaces instead of using domain interfaces
#79 x StatsService error silencing - calculateHabitStats() uses continue on error instead of propagating (internal/service/stats.go:221-223)
